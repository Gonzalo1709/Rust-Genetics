# Rust-Genetics
 Automatic cross breeding for plants

 This is a tool meant to store your available Rust plant genes and attempt to get an ideal clone.
 
 The ideal clone is by default any clone with 4 y's and 2 g's. Order doesn't matter.
 To change the ideal crop change the numbers on the 'goal' dictionary variable at the top of the 'functions.py' file.
 
 This currently works with any crop as genetics work the same for them all.
 To get more genes just plant seeds from the desired crop and when it grows hold e on it and there should be an option to clone the plant.
 
 It is recommended only to clone plants with 4 or more green clones.
 Once you've gotten around 10 clones you can start calculating the crossbreed and hopefully get a desired clone.
 
 Sometimes you'll get a 50/50 chance to get a specific gene, you'll have to crossbreed over and over again until you get the desired gene.
 This program attempts to give you the combination of clones with the least possible 50/50's.
